        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Nelson Mandela was right when he stated, “Education is the most powerful weapon you can utilize to transform the world.” Yes, the solution to any issue lies in education. Education is essential if you want to progress and succeed.
          You can use education to increase both the economical and sociological quality of life in today’s society. Education is power, without any doubt. It has the capacity to transform your entire life. It is a gesture where you accept knowledge and then give methodical directions in return, ranging from promoting gender equality to eliminating poverty..</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Giving money to those in need can be a personally satisfying experience, but there is a choice between donating nationally and internationally through charities or giving directly to those around you. There
          are advantages, however, in giving to charities that are national and international. First and foremost there is the choice of good causes. Locally the kinds of places to help may be limited, but in larger organisations you can get involved
          in such activities as sponsoring a child or conserving wildlife. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Become a Volunteer.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A volunteer is someone who willingly offers their services to an organization. Volunteering is mainly done to help other people in need and to give back to society. Volunteering activities are of different
          types, for instance, skill-based volunteering, micro-volunteering, emergency volunteering, online volunteering, etc. Social organizations are always in need of enthusiastic volunteers who can contribute their time and skills to their
          different programs and serve the community at large. Volunteering helps you build interpersonal skills and accelerates your personal growth. You tend to become a good listener and a good speaker. You become sensitive towards other people’s
          needs. Your contribution of time and skills helps someone find a new hope for their future.</p>
